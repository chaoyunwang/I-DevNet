### 🚀 Introduction
This paper introduces an interactive design method for developable surfaces, centered on a data-driven approach to optimize surface patches for developability. Surface patches are the fundamental components of an entire surface, typically represented by triangular meshes. We propose a novel learning-based method that effectively transforms patches with arbitrary boundaries into their closest developable surfaces. Based on this method, our tools enable real-time, drag-and-drop design of developable surfaces and support piecewise developable approximation through interactive inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that this method provides a fast computational foundation for the interactive design of developable surfaces, enhancing design flexibility while exhibiting excellent robustness and generalization. The piecewise developable approximation of the model, guided by human–computer collaborative segmentation, achieved higher overall approximation accuracy, fewer patches, and lifelike papercraft outcomes. This offers greater flexibility to meet the application requirements of complex real-world scenarios and provides a new paradigm for integrating deep learning with interactive geometry design.
